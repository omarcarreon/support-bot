# üß† Project Description

I'm building an API-first SaaS product that acts as a voice technical support agent for LATAM companies. The system allows human operators to call a phone number and receive automated assistance based on each company's specific operation manuals.

## üèóÔ∏è Main Components

- [ ] Real phone calls (via Twilio)
- [ ] Voice recognition and synthesis in Latin Spanish
- [ ] Multi-tenant backend in FastAPI
- [ ] Semantic ingestion and query of manuals per company (via ChromaDB and Langchain)
- [ ] LLM response generation (GPT-4), in natural language

## üéØ General Objective
To offer a plug-and-play tool for companies with documented technical processes, where the bot acts as a "telephone sherpa" that guides the operator step by step according to the context.

## üéØ Stage 1 Objective (Real MVP)
An operator dials a number ‚Üí backend receives audio ‚Üí transcription ‚Üí client manual consultation ‚Üí response generation ‚Üí voice response.
